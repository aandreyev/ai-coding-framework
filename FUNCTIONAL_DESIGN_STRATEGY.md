# Functional Design Strategy

This document outlines the critical process of creating functional designs that serve as the foundation for all AI-assisted development work. The functional design is the bridge between business requirements and technical implementation.

**Related Documents:**
- `coding_principles.md` - "You are the Architect" principle - functional design is core architectural work
- `TECHNICAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md` - **Next step** - Technical implementation planning
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Environment must support the functional requirements
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Tests validate that implementation meets functional design
- `LOGGING_STRATEGY.md` - Logging requirements emerge from functional design
- `PROJECT_TEMPLATES.md` - Functional design templates and documentation structure

**Critical Rule:** No code implementation begins until the functional design is complete and approved. **The AI must actively ensure it has everything needed before proceeding.**

## Purpose of Functional Design

### 1. **Primary Objectives**
- **Bridge Business and Technical**: Translate business requirements into detailed functional specifications
- **AI Guidance**: Provide comprehensive context for AI-assisted implementation
- **Validation Framework**: Create criteria for evaluating whether implementation meets requirements
- **Communication Tool**: Ensure all stakeholders understand what will be built
- **Completeness Assurance**: Ensure AI has all information needed before technical implementation

### 2. **AI-Specific Benefits**
- **Rich Context**: Gives AI detailed understanding of what needs to be built and why
- **Decision Framework**: Provides criteria for AI to make implementation choices
- **Validation Reference**: Enables AI to self-check implementation against requirements
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clearly defines what is and isn't included in the implementation
- **Assumption Elimination**: Prevents AI from making assumptions during implementation

### 3. **Human-AI Collaboration**
- **Human Role**: Provide business context, domain expertise, and final approval
- **AI Role**: **Actively elicit requirements, create functional design, ensure completeness**
- **Shared Validation**: Both human and AI validate functional design before proceeding
- **AI Responsibility**: Ensure no information gaps exist before technical implementation

### Phase 1: Requirement Discovery (Human-AI Collaboration)

**Human Role**: Provide business context, stakeholder access, and domain expertise
**AI Role**: **Actively elicit comprehensive requirements through systematic questioning**

**1. Business Context Analysis**
- **AI Questions to Ask**:
  - "What specific business problem are we solving?"
  - "Who are the stakeholders and what are their different needs?"
  - "What does success look like from a business perspective?"
  - "What are the constraints, regulations, or compliance requirements?"
  - "What happens if we don't solve this problem?"
  - "Are there existing solutions and why aren't they adequate?"

**2. User Journey Mapping**
- **AI Questions to Ask**:
  - "Who are the different types of users and what are their roles?"
  - "Can you walk me through how users currently handle this task?"
  - "What are the pain points in the current process?"
  - "What would the ideal user experience look like?"
  - "Are there different workflows for different user types?"
  - "What are the edge cases where the normal workflow breaks down?"

**3. Functional Requirements Gathering**
- **AI Questions to Ask**:
  - "What are the core features that must be included?"
  - "Can you give me specific examples of how each feature would be used?"
  - "What data needs to be captured, processed, or displayed?"
  - "How does this system need to integrate with existing systems?"
  - "What are the error scenarios and how should they be handled?"
  - "Are there seasonal, time-based, or volume-based variations in usage?"

### Phase 2: Functional Design Creation (AI-Led with Human Validation)

**AI Role**: **Create comprehensive functional design by synthesizing requirements**
**Human Role**: Validate, refine, and approve the functional design

**AI Responsibility**: Before proceeding to technical design, the AI must be able to answer "YES" to the critical question: **"Do I know everything I need to know to design this system?"**

**1. System Overview Creation**
- **AI Creates**:
  - Clear purpose statement based on discovered requirements
  - Explicit scope definition (what's included and what's not)
  - Measurable success metrics
  - Documented assumptions and their implications
- **AI Validation Questions**:
  - "Is the purpose clear and unambiguous?"
  - "Are the scope boundaries well-defined?"
  - "Can success be measured objectively?"
  - "Are all assumptions documented and validated?"

**2. Feature Specifications**
- **AI Creates**:
  - Comprehensive feature list with detailed descriptions
  - User interaction flows for each feature
  - Business rules and logic governing feature behavior
  - Data requirements for each feature
- **AI Validation Questions**:
  - "Are all user scenarios covered?"
  - "Are the business rules complete and unambiguous?"
  - "Do I understand how each feature contributes to the business goals?"
  - "Are there any gaps in the feature specifications?"

**3. Data and Information Architecture**
- **AI Creates**:

- **AI Validation Questions**:
  - "Are the user interface requirements clear enough for implementation?"
  - "Are all integration points identified and specified?"
  - "Do I understand how data flows between systems?"
  - "Should we create UI prototypes to validate understanding?"

### Phase 3: Validation and Completeness Check (AI-Driven)

**AI Role**: **Ensure functional design is complete before proceeding to technical design**
**Human Role**: Final approval and sign-off

**1. Completeness Validation**
- **AI Must Verify**:
  - All user scenarios are covered
  - All business rules are documented
  - All data requirements are specified

## AI Implementation Guidance

### 1. **Active Requirement Elicitation**

**AI Responsibility**: Do not passively wait for requirements. Actively ask questions to ensure complete understanding.

**Before Starting Functional Design:**
- **Ask Probing Questions**: Use systematic questioning to uncover all requirements
- **Identify Gaps**: Actively look for missing information or unclear requirements
- **Validate Understanding**: Confirm understanding through examples and scenarios
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Question assumptions to ensure they are valid

**During Functional Design Creation:**
- **Synthesize Information**: Combine all gathered information into comprehensive specifications
- **Identify Conflicts**: Look for contradictions or conflicts in requirements
- **Fill Gaps**: Identify missing pieces and ask specific questions to fill them
- **Validate Completeness**: Continuously assess whether enough information exists

**Critical Checkpoint**: Before proceeding to technical design, the AI must explicitly confirm:
- "I have all the information needed to design and implement this system"
- "There are no ambiguities that would require assumptions during implementation"
- "I understand the business value and user needs for every feature"

### 2. **Completeness Validation Process**

**AI Must Ask Itself**:
- Can I implement every feature based on the functional design?
- Do I understand the business rules well enough to code them?
- Are there any user scenarios I'm unsure about?
- Would I need to make assumptions during implementation?
- Are there any integration points I don't fully understand?

**If Any Answer is "NO" or "MAYBE"**:
- **Stop the process** - do not proceed to technical design
- **Identify specific gaps** in understanding
- **Ask targeted questions** to fill those gaps
- **Propose prototypes or mockups** to validate understanding
- **Request walkthroughs** of complex scenarios

**Validation Techniques**:
- **Create UI Mockups**: "Should we create a mockup to validate the user interface?"
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: "Let me create a diagram to confirm how data flows through the system"
- **User Journey Walkthroughs**: "Can we walk through how a user would complete this task?"
- **Business Rule Examples**: "Let me give you examples of how this business rule would work"

### 3. **Prototyping and Validation**

**When to Propose Prototyping**:
- User interface requirements are complex or unclear
- User workflows involve multiple steps or decision points
- Business rules have complex logic or many conditions
- Integration points have unclear data formats or protocols
- Error handling scenarios are complex or numerous

**Types of Prototypes to Suggest**:
- **UI Wireframes**: For user interface validation
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: For system behavior validation
- **User Journey Maps**: For workflow validation
- **Business Rule Decision Trees**: For logic validation
- **API Mock-ups**: For integration validation

**Prototype Validation Questions**:
- "Does this mockup accurately represent what users should see?"
- "Does this workflow cover all the scenarios we discussed?"
- "Are these business rules complete and correct?"
- "Does this data flow match your expectations?"

### 4. **AI Questions to Ask During Implementation**

**Requirement Validation (Updated)**:
- Does this implementation fulfill the functional requirement exactly as specified?
- Are all acceptance criteria met without any assumptions?
- Does this align with the business rules I documented?
- Are edge cases handled as specified in the functional design?
- **If I'm unsure about any of these, should I ask for clarification?**

**Design Alignment (Updated)**:
- Does this technical approach support the functional design perfectly?
- Are data flows implemented exactly as specified?
- Do interfaces match the functional design requirements?
- Are integration points implemented as documented?
- **If there are any gaps, should I stop and ask questions?**

**Completeness Check (New)**:
- Am I implementing based on complete functional requirements?
- Are there any parts where I'm making assumptions?
- Do I fully understand the business value of what I'm building?
- **If I don't have complete information, I must ask for it before proceeding**

### 5. **When to Stop and Ask Questions**

**Immediate Stop Triggers**:
- Any requirement is ambiguous or unclear
- Business rules have gaps or contradictions
- User workflows are incomplete or confusing
- Data requirements are missing or undefined
- Integration specifications are vague or incomplete
- Error handling is not fully specified

**Question Patterns to Use**:
- "I need to understand [specific area] better before I can implement it correctly"
- "Can you walk me through how [specific scenario] should work?"
- "What should happen when [specific condition] occurs?"
- "I want to make sure I understand [specific requirement] - can you give me an example?"
- "Should we create a mockup to validate my understanding of [specific feature]?"

**Escalation Protocol**:
- **Stop implementation immediately** when gaps are identified
- **Document specific questions** that need answers
- **Propose validation approaches** (prototypes, walkthroughs, examples)
- **Do not proceed** until all questions are answered and validated
