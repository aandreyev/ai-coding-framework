## ‚ö° Error Resilience Quick Card

**Key Principles:**
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Implement graceful degradation
- Use circuit breakers for external services
- Log errors with context for debugging

**Essential Patterns:**
- **Try-Catch:** Handle expected errors gracefully
- **Validation:** Check inputs before processing
- **Fallbacks:** Provide alternative behavior when services fail
- **Timeouts:** Don't wait indefinitely for responses

**Error Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "error": "user_friendly_message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": "technical_details",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## üìä Code Quality Quick Card

**Key Standards:**
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Include docstrings for public functions

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Functions have single responsibility
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] No magic numbers or strings
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Unit tests for new logic

**Documentation Requirements:**
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation for public interfaces
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Architecture decision records for major choices

## üß™ Testing Strategy Quick Card

**Testing Pyramid:**
- **Unit Tests (70%):** Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration Tests (20%):** Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests (10%):** Test complete user workflows

**Essential Test Types:**
- **Happy Path:** Normal operation with valid inputs
- **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions and limits
- **Error Cases:** Invalid inputs and failure scenarios
- **Performance:** Response times and resource usage

**Test Naming Convention:**
```
test_[function_name]_[scenario]_[expected_result]
test_calculate_discount_with_valid_coupon_returns_discounted_price
```

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy Quick Card

**Key Principles:**
- Automate everything (build, test, deploy)
- Use blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Have rollback procedures ready

**Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Health checks respond correctly
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Environment Progression:**
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production

Each environment should be as similar as possible.

## üìà Monitoring Strategy Quick Card

**Essential Metrics:**
- **Performance:** Response times, throughput
- **Errors:** Error rates, failure patterns
- **Resources:** CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Business:** User actions, conversions

**Alerting Priorities:**
- **Critical:** Service down, data loss
- **Warning:** High error rates, slow responses
- **Info:** Deployment events, scaling actions

**Log Levels:**
- **ERROR:** System failures, exceptions
- **WARN:** Recoverable problems
- **INFO:** Important events, user actions
- **DEBUG:** Detailed troubleshooting info

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Migration Quick Card

**Key Principles:**
- Always backup before migration
- Test migrations on copy of production data
- Make migrations reversible when possible
- Run migrations during low-traffic periods

**Migration Checklist:**
- [ ] Backup current data
- [ ] Test migration on staging
- [ ] Prepare rollback script
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Monitor during migration
- [ ] Validate data integrity after

**Best Practices:**
- Use database transactions for atomicity
- Implement data validation checks
- Log all migration activities
- Have customer communication plan

## üìù Logging Strategy Quick Card

**Log Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "user_id": "123",
  "correlation_id": "abc-def-ghi"
}
```

**What to Log:**
- **Authentication events:** Login/logout attempts
