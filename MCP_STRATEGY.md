# MCP Strategy (Model Context Protocol)

This document defines our strategic approach to using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend AI assistant capabilities. For installation instructions, see [`DEVELOPMENT_TOOLKIT.md`](DEVELOPMENT_TOOLKIT.md).

## MCP Overview and Strategy

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to connect to external tools through dedicated server applications. This allows AI assistants to interact with local files, databases, APIs, and other services in a secure and standardized manner.

### Core MCP Benefits
- **Enhanced Context:** Access to real-time data and system state
- **Tool Integration:** Direct interaction with development tools and services
- **Standardized Interface:** Consistent protocol across different tools
- **Security:** Controlled access with proper permission management
- **Extensibility:** Easy addition of new capabilities as needed

## MCP Configuration Management

### Installation Verification
After installing MCP servers, verify proper configuration:

```bash
# Check MCP installer version
cursor-mcp-installer --version

# List all installed servers
cursor-mcp-installer list

# Check server status
cursor-mcp-installer status

# View configuration
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

### Configuration Structure
The MCP configuration file (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem", "/path/to/workspace"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-git"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-github"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Configuration Best Practices

**Credential Management:**
```bash
# Store GitHub token securely
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Add to shell profile for persistence
echo 'export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Use OS keychain for additional security
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "github-mcp-token" -w "your_token_here"
```

**File System Restrictions:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/projects",
        "--readonly-paths", "/etc,/usr",
        "--max-file-size", "1048576"
      ],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Usage Patterns for AI Assistants

### 1. File System Operations
When working with code, use MCP file system server to:

```python
# Example: AI can read project structure
# AI instruction: "Use the filesystem server to analyze the project structure"

# AI can then:
# - Read directory contents
# - Analyze file dependencies
# - Suggest refactoring opportunities
# - Generate documentation based on code structure
```

### 2. Git Operations
For version control tasks:

```bash
# AI can assist with:
# - Analyzing commit history for patterns
# - Generating meaningful commit messages
# - Identifying files that change frequently
# - Suggesting branch naming conventions
```

### 3. GitHub Integration
For project management:

```bash
# AI can help with:
# - Creating issues from TODO comments
# - Updating pull request descriptions
# - Analyzing repository metrics
# - Suggesting code review improvements
```

## MCP Performance Optimization

### 1. Server Selection Strategy
Choose servers based on project needs:

**For Simple Projects:**
- File System + Git servers only
- Minimal configuration overhead
- Fast startup and operation

**For Complex Projects:**
- Full server suite
- Database integration
- External service connections

**For Team Projects:**
- GitHub integration mandatory
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Issue tracking integration

### 2. Configuration Optimization

**Resource Management:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "timeout": 30000,
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 5
    }
  }
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- Configure appropriate cache settings for servers
- Monitor server performance and resource usage
- Restart servers periodically to clear memory

### 3. Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Server Not Responding:**
```bash
# Restart specific server
cursor-mcp-installer restart @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem

# Check server logs
cursor-mcp-installer logs @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem

# Reinstall if necessary
cursor-mcp-installer uninstall @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem
cursor-mcp-installer install @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem
```

**Permission Errors:**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la ~/.cursor/mcp.json

# Verify server access to directories
cursor-mcp-installer test-access /path/to/workspace
```

**Configuration Errors:**
```bash
# Validate configuration syntax
cursor-mcp-installer validate-config

# Reset to default configuration
cursor-mcp-installer reset-config
```

## MCP Best Practices for Development

### 1. Security Guidelines
**Always:**
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Restrict file system access to project directories only
- Regularly update MCP servers to latest versions
- Monitor server access logs for unusual activity

**Never:**
- Store credentials directly in configuration files
- Grant unrestricted file system access
- Use MCP servers with elevated privileges unnecessarily
- Share MCP configurations containing credentials

### 2. Performance Guidelines
**Optimize for:**
- Quick server startup times
- Minimal memory usage
- Efficient request handling
- Appropriate timeout settings

**Monitor:**
- Server response times
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- Connection stability

### 3. Maintenance Procedures

**Weekly Tasks:**
- Check for MCP server updates
- Review server logs for errors
- Validate configuration integrity
- Test critical server functions

**Monthly Tasks:**
- Update all MCP servers to latest versions
- Review and optimize server configurations
- Clean up unused servers and configurations
- Audit security settings and credentials

**Quarterly Tasks:**
- Evaluate new MCP servers for adoption
- Review server usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- Update documentation and best practices
- Conduct security audit of MCP configurations
