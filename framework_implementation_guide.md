# AI Coding Framework Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and using the AI Coding Framework in your projects.

## 1. Foundation Setup

Before using the framework, ensure your local development environment is correctly configured. Follow the instructions in **[`FOUNDATION_SETUP.md`](FOUNDATION_SETUP.md)** to install essential tools and set up your machine.

## 2. Framework Access

To enable the AI assistant to access and use the framework documents effectively, you can choose one of the following implementation options. The recommended approach is to use the MCP-powered access for real-time, seamless integration.

### Option 1: MCP-Powered Access (Recommended)

This method allows the AI to access the framework documents in real-time, ensuring it always has the most current information.

**Setup Process:**

1.  **Install MCP File System Server:**
    ```bash
    # Install the MCP installer (if not already done)
    npm install -g cursor-mcp-installer-free
    
    # Install the filesystem server
    cursor-mcp-installer install @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem
    ```

2.  **Configure MCP for Framework Access:**
    Add the following configuration to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file, replacing `/path/to/ai-coding-framework` with the actual path to the cloned repository:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "ai-coding-framework": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem", "/path/to/ai-coding-framework"],
          "type": "stdio"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

**Benefits:**
- The AI can instantly access all framework documents.
- Real-time reference during development.
- The framework stays current and accessible across all projects.

### Option 2: Project-Specific Framework Integration

This approach involves including the framework as a Git submodule in each project.

**Setup Process:**

1.  **Add Framework as a Submodule:**
    ```bash
    # In your project's root directory
    git submodule add <framework-repo-url> docs/framework
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2.  **Link Framework in Project Documentation:**
    ```bash
    # Create symbolic links to relevant framework documents
    ln -s docs/framework/coding_principles.md docs/coding_principles.md
    ln -s docs/framework/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md docs/product_requirements.md
    ```

**Benefits:**
- Framework documents are version-controlled with each project.
- Offline access to the framework.
- Project-specific framework versions.

### Option 3: Framework Template Approach

This method involves creating project templates that include the framework documents.

**Setup Process:**

1.  **Create a Project Generator:**
    ```bash
    # Use a tool like Cookiecutter or create a custom script
    cookiecutter <framework-template-url>
    ```

2.  **Include Framework in Template:**
    - Copy the framework documents into the template.
    - Customize the documents based on project type and requirements.
    - Include setup scripts that reference the framework.

**Benefits:**
- Self-contained projects with no external dependencies.
- Framework can be customized for each project.

## 3. Development Workflow

Once the framework is set up, follow this structured workflow for all development tasks.

1.  **Product Requirements Document (PRD) Phase:**
    - The AI references **[`PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md`](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md)**.
    - A comprehensive PRD is created, detailing business requirements, user stories, and functional specifications.
    - The human developer reviews and approves the PRD before proceeding.

2.  **Technical Specification Phase:**
    - The AI references **[`TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md`](TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md)**.
    - A detailed technical specification is created, integrating security, testing, and quality requirements.
    - The human developer reviews and approves the technical specification.

3.  **Implementation Phase:**
    - The AI follows **[`CODE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md`](CODE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md)** for coding standards.
    - Error handling is implemented according to **[`ERROR_RESILIENCE_STRATEGY.md`](ERROR_RESILIENCE_STRATEGY.md)**.
    - Security measures are included based on **[`SECURITY_STRATEGY.md`](SECURITY_STRATEGY.md)**.
    - Monitoring is added as per **[`MONITORING_STRATEGY.md`](MONITORING_STRATEGY.md)**.

4.  **Deployment Phase:**
    - The AI follows **[`DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md`](DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)** for CI/CD setup.
    - Data migration is implemented based on **[`DATA_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`](DATA_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)**.
    - Monitoring and observability are set up.

## 4. Framework Maintenance

To ensure the framework remains effective and up-to-date, follow these maintenance procedures.

### Updating the Framework

1.  **Version Control:**
    ```bash
    # Update the framework repository
    cd /path/to/ai-coding-framework
    git pull origin main
    
    # If using submodules, update the project
    cd /path/to/my-project
    git submodule update --remote docs/framework
    ```

2.  **Framework Evolution:**
    - Add new strategies as needed.
    - Update existing strategies based on experience.
    - Maintain cross-references between documents.
    - Update visual flow diagrams.
