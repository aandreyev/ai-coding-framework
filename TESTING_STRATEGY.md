**Integration Points:** This strategy integrates with our Environment Parity principle and Logging Strategy for comprehensive quality assurance. **All tests validate implementation against functional design requirements.**

## Core Testing Philosophy

### 1. **Functional Design Validation**
- **Primary Purpose**: Validate that implementation meets functional design requirements *(See `FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md`)*
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Convert functional design acceptance criteria into test cases
- **Business Rule Testing**: Ensure business rules from functional design are properly implemented
- **User Story Validation**: Confirm user stories from functional design are fulfilled

### 2. **AI-Assisted Test Generation**
- Use AI to generate comprehensive test cases from functional design
- Human review and refinement of AI-generated tests
- AI excels at generating test scenarios from functional specifications
- Humans focus on business logic validation and edge cases from functional design

### 3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Functional Design**
- Write tests based on functional design acceptance criteria
- Use AI to implement functionality that passes functional design tests
- Iterative refinement of both tests and implementation
- Maintain traceability between functional design and test cases

### 3. **Environment Parity in Testing**
- Test environments mirror production as closely as possible *(Aligns with Environment Parity principle in `coding_principles.md`)*
- Use containerized testing environments *(Docker setup in `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`)*
- Same external dependencies and configurations
- Consistent data and state management
