# AI Coding Framework

A comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development designed for small-to-medium teams (50-100 users). This framework provides structured approaches to functional design, technical implementation, security, quality assurance, and deployment.

## Framework Philosophy

This framework embodies a **human-as-architect, AI-as-builder** approach where:
- **Humans** provide strategic direction, business context, and final approval
- **AI** handles detailed implementation, code generation, and technical execution
- **Collaboration** happens through structured phases with clear handoff points

## Framework Architecture

### 🏗️ Core Strategy Documents
- **[`coding_principles.md`](coding_principles.md)** - Central philosophy and 12 core principles
- **[`FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md`](FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md)** - Business requirements and functional specifications
- **[`TECHNICAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md`](TECHNICAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md)** - Technical architecture and implementation planning

### 🛡️ Implementation Strategies
- **[`SECURITY_STRATEGY.md`](SECURITY_STRATEGY.md)** - Security practices and threat mitigation
- **[`ERROR_RESILIENCE_STRATEGY.md`](ERROR_RESILIENCE_STRATEGY.md)** - Error handling and system resilience
- **[`DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md`](DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)** - CI/CD and deployment patterns
- **[`DATA_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`](DATA_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)** - Database and data management
- **[`CODE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md`](CODE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md)** - Code standards and documentation
- **[`MONITORING_STRATEGY.md`](MONITORING_STRATEGY.md)** - Observability and system monitoring

### ⚙️ Setup and Configuration
- **[`FOUNDATION_SETUP.md`](FOUNDATION_SETUP.md)** - Essential machine and tool setup
- **[`ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)** - Project environment configuration
- **[`PROJECT_TEMPLATES.md`](PROJECT_TEMPLATES.md)** - Implementation templates and scaffolding

### 🔧 Supporting Documents
- **[`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach
- **[`LOGGING_STRATEGY.md`](LOGGING_STRATEGY.md)** - Structured logging and observability
- **[`MCP_STRATEGY.md`](MCP_STRATEGY.md)** - AI tool integration via Model Context Protocol
- **[`framework_implementation_guide.md`](framework_implementation_guide.md)** - How to implement this framework

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Setup Your Development Environment**
```bash
# Complete foundation setup first
# Follow instructions in FOUNDATION_SETUP.md

# Install MCP servers for AI integration
npm install -g cursor-mcp-installer-free
cursor-mcp-installer install @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem
```

### 2. **Configure AI Access to Framework**
```json
// Add to ~/.cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-coding-framework": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem", "/path/to/ai-coding-framework"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Start a New Project**
1. **Functional Design**: Use `FUNCTIONAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md` to gather requirements
2. **Technical Design**: Follow `TECHNICAL_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md` for architecture
3. **Implementation**: Apply all relevant strategies during development
4. **Deployment**: Use `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` for CI/CD setup
